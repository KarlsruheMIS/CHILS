# CHILS â€” Concurrent Hybrid Iterated Local Search

## Installation

Clone the project by using the following command.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:KarlsruheMIS/CHILS.git
```

Alternatively, if you cloned the repository without the `--recurse-submodules` option, you can also run the following command to retrieve the CHILS project.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Move into the CHILS folder and type `make` to build the project. This creates the executable file **CHILS** in the same directory. Refer to the README or run the program with the `-h` option for more information on how to use the heuristic.
